# Architecture Overview

Kube-VIM is built on modern cloud-native principles, providing a robust foundation for NFV workloads on Kubernetes.

## Design Principles

### Cloud-Native Architecture
- Built for Kubernetes with modern API interfaces
- GitOps deployment patterns for operational excellence
- Real-time monitoring and observability
- Auto-scaling capabilities for dynamic workloads

### Security First
- Talos immutable OS foundation
- Secure-by-default architecture
- Hardware abstraction for diverse infrastructure
- Compliance with telecom security standards

### Performance Optimized
- DPDK for high-performance packet processing
- SR-IOV for hardware acceleration
- Kernel bypass technologies
- Edge-to-core deployment flexibility

## Core Components

### Virtualization Layer
- **KubeVirt** provides VM-based VNF support
- **Container-based** CNF support
- **Multi-tenancy** for service provider environments
- **Resource isolation** and performance guarantees

### Networking Stack
- **Kube-OVN** for k8s-native networking
- **5G network slicing** capabilities
- **Hardware acceleration** support
- **Diverse topology** support

### Management & Orchestration
- **OSM integration** for MANO orchestrator connectivity
- **OpenStack Tacker** as physical orchestrator
- **REST/gRPC APIs** with Protobuf for efficiency
- **Zero-touch provisioning** automation

## Standards Compliance

### ETSI NFV Standards
- **NFV-IFA 005** (Or-Vi interface) support
- **NFV-IFA 006** (Vi-Vnfm interface) support
- **ETSI MANO** compliance and certification readiness
- **Modern API interfaces** for integration

### Performance Standards
- **Telco-grade SLAs** with 99.99% availability
- **Carrier-grade reliability** and fault tolerance
- **Real-time performance** guarantees
- **Enterprise-scale** workload support

## **TBD** Detailed Architecture

Comprehensive architecture diagrams and component interaction details will be provided in future documentation releases.
